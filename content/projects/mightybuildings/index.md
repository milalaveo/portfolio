#### Mobile app
My primary focus was on developing a mobile application with a virtual reality feature, enabling users to book house tours of their desired properties. Throughout this process, I collaborated closely with stakeholders and frequently had to justify and defend my design decisions. Additionally, I worked on crafting internal tools to streamline production regulation at the factory, as well as creating a customer portal for seamless interactions.
