#### challenges
During the application's design process, I encountered situations where I had to vigorously defend specific design solutions due to limited development resources. Despite the challenges, I remained committed to advocating for the best possible user experience and worked closely with the development team to find feasible solutions that aligned with the project's constraints. This experience strengthened my ability to balance creative vision with practical considerations and reinforced the importance of effective communication and collaboration within the design and development teams.
