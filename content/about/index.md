Since 2018, I've had the privilege of working as a consultant 
with leading companies and holdings across Asia. From creating 
promo pages for the Korean Broadcasting System to developing a 
mobile application for the Japanese bank Shinsei, I've been 
involved in diverse and exciting projects. Throughout my experiences, 
I've learned the art of collaborating with different teams, 
aligning business and technical requirements to achieve shared goals.

My fintech work opened doors to a significant project - a 
leading payment system in Central Asia. There, I delved into 
the world of high-load user systems and gained invaluable experience 
building design systems from the ground up. I also took the lead in 
user research, testing, and presenting design solutions to stakeholders.

Later, I joined an American startup focused on 3D-printed house 
production. My role involved creating modules for the corporate 
ERP system and designing interfaces for the company's clients.

Now, at Epam Systems, I find myself immersed in a diverse task 
pool that encompasses various design activities. Each project 
adds to my expertise and fuels my passion for creating innovative 
and user-centric solutions.

As I look ahead, I'm excited to continue exploring new challenges, 
growing as a designer, and making a positive impact through my work.
